Looking through these definitions systematically, I find that the vast majority are mathematically accurate and align with standard usage. Here are the few corrections and clarifications needed:

## Minor Issues to Address:

### 1. **Cosegment**
The given definition appears to conflate this with concepts from model categories. A **cosegment** is typically just the **walking arrow category** $\mathbf{2} = \{0 \to 1\}$, viewed as a cocartesian fibration over the terminal category.

### 2. **Locally presentable category**
The definition should be more precise: A **locally presentable category** is a cocomplete category that has a small set of κ-compact generators for some regular cardinal κ. An object is κ-compact if its hom-functor preserves κ-filtered colimits.

### 3. **∗Complicial set**
While the definition captures the essence, the "∗" notation is non-standard. Complicial sets are typically unmarked in the notation, with the marking being part of the structure.

### 4. **Homotopy coherent diagram**
The definition could be clearer. A **homotopy coherent diagram** of shape $\mathcal{I}$ in an ∞-category $\mathcal{C}$ is precisely a functor $\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{C}$ when both are viewed as ∞-categories (e.g., via their nerves).

### 5. **Icon**
While the definition captures the idea, it should specify that an **icon** is an identity-on-objects, identity-on-1-cells lax natural transformation between lax functors.

## Particularly Well-Done Definitions:

- The **coend** and **end** definitions with proper integral notation
- The distinction between **weak** and **strict** n-categories
- The **A∞-algebra** definition mentioning Stasheff polytopes
- The **shifted symplectic structure** capturing modern derived geometry

## Overall Assessment:

These definitions demonstrate excellent mathematical precision and coverage of both classical and cutting-edge topics in category theory. The progression from classical concepts through higher categories to applications in physics and algebraic geometry is comprehensive and well-organized. The definitions appropriately use standard notation and terminology consistent with nLab conventions.

The document serves as an excellent reference, requiring only the minor corrections noted above.
