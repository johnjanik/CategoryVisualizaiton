Most of these definitions are essentially correct as stated. Below I list the few entries that need adjustment or clarification; all others can be taken as accurate.

---

#### Classical Category Theory

* **Category of elements**

  * **Issue:** The arrow‐condition is reversed.
  * **Fix:** A morphism $(c,x)\to(c',x')$ is $f:c\to c'$ **such that** $F(f)(x)=x'$, not $F(f)(x')=x$.

* **Cosegment**

  * **Issue:** “Morphism from an initial object (dual to segment)” is not standard terminology.
  * **Fix:** Either remove this entry or replace with a precise definition (e.g. “a dual notion to segment used in certain topos‐theoretic contexts; rarely used in ordinary category theory”).

* **Coefficient**

  * **Issue:** Definition is too vague and context‐dependent.
  * **Fix:** Either omit or replace by one of the standard uses, for example “in an enriched category $\mathcal V$-category, the objects of $\mathcal V$ are sometimes called coefficients when indexing tensors and cotensors.”

* **Exact category**

  * **Issue:** “Eilenberg–Moore axioms” is not the usual reference for Quillen’s exact categories.
  * **Fix:**

    > An exact category is an additive category equipped with a distinguished class of “short exact sequences” satisfying Quillen’s axioms (see Quillen 1973), making it a full subcategory of an abelian category closed under extensions.

* **Limit**

  * **Issue:** The parenthetical “inverse limit for diagrams in posets” is misleading (inverse limits are just one example).
  * **Fix:** Simply state

    > A limit is a universal cone over a diagram in a category (e.g.\ products, equalizers, pullbacks).

* **Grothendieck fibration**

  * **Issue:** The description “morphisms in $\mathcal E$ lift ‘cartesianly’” is shorthand.
  * **Fix (optional precision):**

    > A functor $P\colon\mathcal E\to\mathcal B$ is a (Grothendieck) fibration if for every arrow $f\colon b'\to P(e)$ in $\mathcal B$ there is a $P$-**cartesian** arrow $\tilde f\colon e'\to e$ with $P(\tilde f)=f$, and these cartesian lifts compose appropriately.

All **other** entries in your list match the standard definitions in Mac Lane’s “Categories for the Working Mathematician” (and their obvious higher‐ and topos‐theoretic extensions). Let me know if you’d like any further detail on these fixes or if I should check any other subtle points!
