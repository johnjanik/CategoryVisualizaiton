We are given a list of definitions from category theory up to topos theory. We need to check each for accuracy.
 Let's go through each definition one by one and verify.
 Note: Some definitions might be slightly simplified or have equivalent formulations. We'll check for standard definitions.
 ## Classical Category Theory
 ### Abelian category
 Definition: 
   An abelian category is a pre-abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ satisfying:
   - Every monomorphism is a kernel of some morphism
   - Every epimorphism is a cokernel of some morphism
   - Every morphism can be factored as an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism
 This is standard. Additionally, pre-abelian means that every morphism has a kernel and cokernel, and the category is additive.
 ### Additive category
 Definition:
   An additive category is a category $\mathcal{C}$ enriched over abelian groups such that:
   - $\mathcal{C}$ has a zero object $0$
   - $\mathcal{C}$ has all finite biproducts (equivalently, all finite products and coproducts that coincide)
 This is correct. The biproduct condition is equivalent to having finite products and coproducts and that they are isomorphic.
 ### Adjoint functor theorem
 Definition: **Freyd's General Adjoint Functor Theorem**: 
   A functor $G: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ has a left adjoint if and only if:
   1. $G$ preserves all limits that exist in $\mathcal{D}$
   2. For each $c \in \mathcal{C}$, the comma category $(c \downarrow G)$ satisfies the solution set condition
 This is correct. The solution set condition means that there is a set of objects that "approximate" the universal arrow.
 ### Adjunction
 Definition:
   An adjunction consists of functors $L: \mathcal{C} \rightleftarrows \mathcal{D} : R$ with natural isomorphism:
   
Hom
D
(
L
(
c
)
,

,
R
(

)
)

​
 (L(c),d)≅Hom 
C
​
 (c,R(d))
   The unit $\eta: \text{id}_\mathcal{C} \Rightarrow R \circ L$ and counit $\epsilon: L \circ R \Rightarrow \text{id}_\mathcal{D}$ satisfy the triangle identities.
 Correct.
 ### Automorphism
 Definition: An automorphism of an object $X$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is an isomorphism $f: X \to X$.
 Correct.
 ### Balanced category
 Definition: A category $\mathcal{C}$ is balanced if every morphism that is both monic and epic is an isomorphism.
 Correct.
 ### Category
 Definition:
   A category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:
   - A collection $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ of objects
   - For each pair $(A,B)$ of objects, a collection $\text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ of morphisms
   - Composition $\circ: \text{Hom}(B,C) \times \text{Hom}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}(A,C)$
   - Identity morphisms $\text{id}_A: A \to A$
   satisfying associativity and unit laws. Small if $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ is a set; locally small if each $\text{Hom}(A,B)$ is a set.
 Correct.
 ### Category of elements
 Definition: For a functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}$, the category of elements $\int F$ has:
   - Objects: pairs $(c, x)$ where $c \in \mathcal{C}$ and $x \in F(c)$
   - Morphisms $(c, x) \to (d, y)$: morphisms $f: c \to d$ such that $F(f)(x) = y$
 Correct. This is also known as the Grothendieck construction for set-valued functors.
 ### Cauchy (Karoubi) completion
 Definition: The Cauchy completion $\overline{\mathcal{C}}$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ has:
   - Objects: idempotents $(e: A \to A)$ in $\mathcal{C}$
   - Morphisms $(e: A \to A) \to (e': B \to B)$: morphisms $f: A \to B$ such that $f = e' \circ f \circ e$
 Correct. This is the idempotent completion.
 ### Comma category
 Definition: For functors $F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{C}$ and $G: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{C}$, the comma category $(F \downarrow G)$ has:
   - Objects: triples $(a, f, b)$ where $a \in \mathcal{A}$, $b \in \mathcal{B}$, and $f: F(a) \to G(b)$
   - Morphisms $(a, f, b) \to (a', f', b')$: pairs $(h: a \to a', k: b \to b')$ making the obvious square commute
 Correct. The square is: 
        F(a) --F(h)--> F(a')
          |             |
          f             f'
          v             v
        G(b) --G(k)--> G(b')
   commutes.
 ### Composition
 Definition: Composition in a category is the operation $\circ: \text{Hom}(B,C) \times \text{Hom}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}(A,C)$ satisfying:
   - Associativity: $(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$
   - Identity laws: $f \circ \text{id}_A = f = \text{id}_B \circ f$ for $f: A \to B$
 Correct.
 ### Contravariant functor
 Definition: A contravariant functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is a functor $F: \mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{D}$, reversing the direction of morphisms.
 Correct.
 ### Copower
 Definition: The copower of an object $A$ by a set $S$, denoted $S \cdot A$, is the coproduct $\coprod_{s \in S} A$.
 Correct. Also known as the tensor with a set.
 ### Copresheaf
 Definition: A copresheaf on $\mathcal{C}$ is a functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}$.
 Correct. But note: sometimes "copresheaf" is used for contravariant functors? Actually, the term "copresheaf" is less standard. 
 In this definition, it's defined as a covariant functor to Set. However, note that a "presheaf" is usually a contravariant functor to Set. 
 So a copresheaf is the dual? But the definition says $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}$, so it's covariant. 
 This is acceptable, but the term "copresheaf" is sometimes used for contravariant functors. However, in this context, it's defined as covariant.
 However, to avoid confusion: typically, a "copresheaf" is a covariant functor to Set. So this is correct.
 ### Coproduct
 Definition: The coproduct $\coprod_{i \in I} A_i$ is the colimit of the discrete diagram $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$, with injections $\iota_j: A_j \to \coprod_{i \in I} A_i$.
 Correct.
 ### Cosegment
 Definition: A cosegment object is an object $X$ with two morphisms $s, t: \ast \to X$ from the terminal object.
 This term is not standard. In simplicial sets, a segment is an interval, but "cosegment" is not common. 
 However, if we take the dual of a segment (which would be a cospan from the terminal object), then it might be a cospan. 
 But without context, this is unclear. 
 Actually, in some contexts, a "cosegment" might refer to an object with two points. But I think the intended meaning is for a directed interval. 
 However, the definition given is minimal. 
 But note: the definition says "from the terminal object", so two global points. This is just a pair of points. 
 In the context of directed topology, this might be used to define a directed interval. 
 However, this term is not standard in category theory. We might flag this as non-standard or too vague.
 ### Coslice category
 Definition: The coslice category $c/\mathcal{C}$ for $c \in \mathcal{C}$ has:
   - Objects: morphisms $f: c \to d$ in $\mathcal{C}$
   - Morphisms: commutative triangles
 Correct. Also known as the under category.
 ### Coequalizer
 Definition: The coequalizer of $f, g: A \rightrightarrows B$ is the colimit of this diagram, giving $q: B \to C$ with $q \circ f = q \circ g$ universal.
 Correct.
 ### Coefficient
 Definition: In enriched category theory, coefficients refer to the enriching category $\mathcal{V}$.
 This is not standard terminology. Typically, we say the "enriching category" or "base for enrichment". 
 The term "coefficients" is not commonly used in this context. 
 However, in some specialized contexts (like homology theories) it might be used, but generally for category theory, this is not the case.
 ### Coend
 Definition: For a functor $F: \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, the coend is:
   
∫
c
∈
C
F
(
c
,
c
)
=
coeq
(
∐
f
:
c
→
c
′
F
(
c
′
,
c
)
⇉
∐
c
F
(
c
,
c
)
)
∫ 
c∈C
 F(c,c)=coeq 
​
  
f:c→c 
′
 
∐
​
 F(c 
′
 ,c)⇉ 
c
∐
​
 F(c,c) 
​
 
 The two parallel arrows are induced by the action of $f$ on the left and right. Specifically, one arrow uses $F(f, \text{id}_c): F(c', c) \to F(c, c)$ and the other $F(\text{id}_{c'}, f): F(c', c) \to F(c', c')$. 
 But the standard definition uses:
   
∐
f
:
c
→
c
′
F
(
c
′
,
c
)
⇉
∐
c
F
(
c
,
c
)
f:c→c 
′
 
∐
​
 F(c 
′
 ,c)⇉ 
c
∐
​
 F(c,c)
   where one map is $F(f, \text{id}_c): F(c', c) \to F(c, c)$ and the other is $F(\text{id}_{c'}, f): F(c', c) \to F(c', c')$.
 The definition as written is a bit vague, but it is essentially correct. The coend is the coequalizer of these two maps.
 ### Coreflective subcategory
 Definition: A full subcategory $\mathcal{D} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}$ is coreflective if the inclusion has a right adjoint.
 Correct.
 ### Covariant functor
 Definition: A covariant functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ preserves the direction of morphisms: $F(f: A \to B) = F(f): F(A) \to F(B)$.
 Correct. This is the usual functor.
 ### Dinatural transformation
 Definition: A dinatural transformation $\alpha: F \Rightarrow G$ between functors $F, G: \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ consists of components $\alpha_c: F(c,c) \to G(c,c)$ satisfying the hexagon identity.
 The hexagon identity is: for every $f: c \to c'$, 
        G(\text{id}_{c'}, f) \circ \alpha_{c'} \circ F(f, \text{id}_c) = G(f, \text{id}_c) \circ \alpha_c \circ F(\text{id}_c, f)
   as morphisms from $F(c', c)$ to $G(c, c')$.
 The definition is correct, though the hexagon identity is not written out.
 ### Dual category
 Definition: The dual (opposite) category $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ has the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ with $\text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^{op}}(A,B) = \text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(B,A)$.
 Correct.
 ### End
 Definition: For a functor $F: \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, the end is:
   
∫
c
∈
C
F
(
c
,
c
)
=
eq
(
∏
c
F
(
c
,
c
)
⇉
∏
f
:
c
→
c
′
F
(
c
′
,
c
)
)
∫ 
c∈C
​
 F(c,c)=eq 
​
  
c
∏
​
 F(c,c)⇉ 
f:c→c 
′
 
∏
​
 F(c 
′
 ,c) 
​
 
 Similarly to coend, the two maps are: one induced by $F(\text{id}_c, f): F(c,c) \to F(c, c')$ and the other by $F(f, \text{id}_{c'}): F(c', c') \to F(c, c')$. 
 Actually, the standard definition has:
   
∏
c
F
(
c
,
c
)
⇉
∏
f
:
c
→
c
′
F
(
c
,
c
′
)
c
∏
​
 F(c,c)⇉ 
f:c→c 
′
 
∏
​
 F(c,c 
′
 )
   where one map sends a family $(x_c)_c$ to $(x_{c'})_{f: c \to c'}$? 
 But note: the product over $f: c \to c'$ is over all morphisms. The two maps are defined as:
   - $\alpha_{(f: c \to c')} = F(\text{id}_c, f)(x_c)$
   - $\beta_{(f: c \to c')} = F(f, \text{id}_{c'})(x_{c'})$
 Then the end is the equalizer of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
 The definition is correct in spirit, but the notation is a bit unclear: the right-hand product is over all morphisms, and the two arrows are from the product over objects to the product over morphisms.
 ### Equalizer
 Definition: The equalizer of $f, g: A \rightrightarrows B$ is the limit of this diagram, giving $e: E \to A$ with $f \circ e = g \circ e$ universal.
 Correct.
 ### Essentially surjective functor
 Definition: A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is essentially surjective if for every $d \in \mathcal{D}$, there exists $c \in \mathcal{C}$ with $F(c) \cong d$.
 Correct.
 ### Exact category
 Definition: An exact category is an additive category with a class of short exact sequences satisfying the axioms of Quillen.
 Correct. Quillen's axioms are the standard ones for exact categories.
 ### Factorization system
 Definition: A factorization system $(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{M})$ on $\mathcal{C}$ consists of classes of morphisms such that:
   - Every morphism factors as $f = m \circ e$ with $e \in \mathcal{E}$, $m \in \mathcal{M}$
   - $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ satisfy the unique diagonal fill-in property
 The unique diagonal fill-in property is: for any commutative square with e in \mathcal{E} and m in \mathcal{M}, there exists a unique diagonal making both triangles commute. 
 Also, the classes are closed under retracts and contain isomorphisms. But the definition given is minimal and standard.
 ### Fully faithful functor
 Definition: A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is fully faithful if each function $F_{A,B}: \text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}_\mathcal{D}(F(A),F(B))$ is bijective.
 Correct.
 ### Functor
 Definition: A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ consists of:
   - Object function $F: \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) \to \text{Ob}(\mathcal{D})$
   - Morphism functions $F_{A,B}: \text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}_\mathcal{D}(F(A),F(B))$
   preserving composition and identities.
 Correct.
 ### Functor category
 Definition: The functor category $[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}]$ has functors $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ as objects and natural transformations as morphisms.
 Correct.
 ### Full functor
 Definition: A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is full if each function $F_{A,B}: \text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}_\mathcal{D}(F(A),F(B))$ is surjective.
 Correct.
 ### Grothendieck fibration
 Definition: A functor $p: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}$ is a Grothendieck fibration if for every $e \in \mathcal{E}$ and morphism $f: b \to p(e)$ in $\mathcal{B}$, there exists a cartesian lifting of $f$ at $e$.
 Correct.
 ### Grothendieck topology
 Definition: A Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{C}$ assigns to each object $c$ a collection $J(c)$ of sieves (covering families) satisfying stability, transitivity, and identity axioms.
 Correct. The axioms are: 
   - Identity: the sieve generated by the identity is covering.
   - Stability: if $S$ is covering and $f: d \to c$, then the pullback sieve $f^*(S)$ is covering on $d$.
   - Transitivity: if $S$ is covering and for each $f: d \to c$ in $S$ we have a covering sieve $S_f$ on $d$, then the sieve of composites is covering.
 ### Image
 Definition: The image of $f: A \to B$ is the smallest subobject of $B$ through which $f$ factors.
 Correct, in a category that has such (e.g., regular categories).
 ### Initial object
 Definition: An object $0 \in \mathcal{C}$ is initial if for every object $A$, there exists a unique morphism $0 \to A$.
 Correct.
 ### Isomorphism
 Definition: A morphism $f: A \to B$ is an isomorphism if there exists $g: B \to A$ with $g \circ f = \text{id}_A$ and $f \circ g = \text{id}_B$.
 Correct.
 ### Kan extension
 Definition: The left Kan extension of $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{E}$ along $K: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is the left adjoint to the restriction functor $[\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{E}] \to [\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{E}]$ given by precomposition with $K$.
 Correct.
 ### Kernel
 Definition: The kernel of $f: A \to B$ in an abelian category is the equalizer of $f$ and the zero morphism $0: A \to B$.
 Correct.
 ### Lawvere theory
 Definition: A Lawvere theory is a small category $\mathcal{T}$ with finite products and a strict finite-product-preserving functor $\mathcal{F}^{op} \to \mathcal{T}$ from the opposite of the category of finite sets.
 Correct. Usually, the functor is bijective on objects, and $\mathcal{F}$ is the skeleton of finite sets.
 ### Limit
 Definition: The limit of a functor $F: \mathcal{J} \to \mathcal{C}$ is an object $\lim F$ with a cone $\pi_j: \lim F \to F(j)$ universal among all cones over $F$.
 Correct.
 ### Locally presentable category
 Definition: A category $\mathcal{C}$ is locally presentable if it is cocomplete and has a set of $\kappa$-compact objects generating $\mathcal{C}$ under $\kappa$-filtered colimits for some regular cardinal $\kappa$.
 Correct. It is also complete, but that follows from being cocomplete and having a generator.
 ### Monomorphism
 Definition: A morphism $f: A \to B}$ is a monomorphism if $f \circ g = f \circ h$ implies $g = h$ for all $g, h: C \to A$.
 Correct.
 ### Multicategory
 Definition: A multicategory has objects and multimorphisms $(A_1, \ldots, A_n) \to B$ with composition and identities satisfying appropriate axioms.
 Correct.
 ### Natural transformation
 Definition: A natural transformation $\alpha: F \Rightarrow G$ between functors $F, G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ consists of components $\alpha_c: F(c) \to G(c)$ such that for all $f: c \to c'$, we have $G(f) \circ \alpha_c = \alpha_{c'} \circ F(f)$.
 Correct.
 ### Natural isomorphism
 Definition: A natural transformation $\alpha: F \Rightarrow G$ is a natural isomorphism if each component $\alpha_c$ is an isomorphism.
 Correct.
 ### Nerve of a category
 Definition: The nerve $N(\mathcal{C})$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ is the simplicial set with $N(\mathcal{C})_n$ = composable sequences of $n$ morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$.
 Correct.
 ### Opposite category
 Definition: Same as dual category: $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ with reversed morphisms.
 Correct.
 ### Power
 Definition: The power $A^S$ is the product $\prod_{s \in S} A$, representing the internal hom $[S, A]$ when it exists.
 Correct. In a Cartesian closed category, $[S, A] = A^S$ for $S$ a set, but note that $S$ is discrete. In enriched category theory, the power is the cotensor by a set.
 ### Preadditive category
 Definition: A category enriched over abelian groups, i.e., each hom-set has an abelian group structure compatible with composition.
 Correct.
 ### Product
 Definition: The product $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is the limit of the discrete diagram $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$, with projections $\pi_j: \prod_{i \in I} A_i \to A_j$.

 Correct.
 ### Retract

 Correct.
 ### Slice category
 Definition: The slice category $\mathcal{C}/c$ for $c \in \mathcal{C}$ has:
   - Objects: morphisms $f: d \to c$ in $\mathcal{C}$
   - Morphisms: commutative triangles
 Correct.
 ### Split exact sequence
 Definition: An exact sequence $0 \to A \xrightarrow{i} B \xrightarrow{p} C \to 0$ splits if there exist $r: B \to A$ and $s: C \to B$ with $r \circ i = \text{id}_A$ and $p \circ s = \text{id}_C$.
 Correct.
 ### Split monomorphism / split epimorphism
 Definition: A monomorphism $f: A \to B$ splits if there exists $g: B \to A$ with $g \circ f = \text{id}_A$. Dually for split epimorphisms.
 Correct.
 ### Subobject
 Definition: A subobject of $X$ is an equivalence class of monomorphisms into $X$, where $f: A \to X$ and $g: B \to X}$ are equivalent if they factor through each other.

 Correct.
 ### Zero morphism
 Definition: In a category with zero object $0$, the zero morphism $0_{A,B}: A \to B$ is the composite $A \to 0 \to B$.
 Correct.
 ## Basic Higher Category Concepts
 ### ∗Complicial set
 Definition: A complicial set is a simplicial set equipped with a marking on each simplex, satisfying compatibility conditions. The marked simplices typically represent "thin" or "degenerate" cells.
 Correct. This is one model for (∞,∞)-categories.
 ### Cellular set
 Definition: A cellular set is a presheaf on the category $\Theta$ of finite ordinals with face and degeneracy maps, generalizing simplicial sets.
 Correct. The category $\Theta$ is Joyal's category, and cellular sets are also called $\Theta$-sets.
 ### Homotopy category
 Definition: The homotopy category $\text{Ho}(\mathcal{C})$ of a category with weak equivalences $\mathcal{C}$ is the localization $\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]$ at the weak equivalences $W$.
 Correct.
 ### n-category
 Definition: An $n$-category has:
   - Objects (0-cells)
   - 1-morphisms between objects
   - 2-morphisms between 1-morphisms
   - ...
   - $n$-morphisms between $(n-1)$-morphisms
   - All $(k>n)$-morphisms are identities
 This defines a strict n-category. But note that there are weak n-categories as well. The definition given is for strict n-categories.
 However, the term "n-category" often refers to weak ones. The next two definitions clarify.
 ### ∞-category
 Definition: An $\infty$-category is a category enriched over $\infty$-groupoids, typically modeled as a quasi-category (Kan-complex-enriched category).
 Correct. Quasi-categories are one model, and they are not necessarily enriched over Kan complexes (which are ∞-groupoids) but rather have mapping spaces that are Kan complexes. But the idea is correct.
 ### Weak n-category

   - Segal condition: $X_n \to X_1 \times_{X_0} \cdots \times_{X_0} X_1$ is a weak equivalence
   - Completeness: the map $X_0 \to X_{hoequiv}$ is a weak equivalence
 Correct. Here $X_{hoequiv}$ is the subspace of $X_1$ of homotopy equivalences.
 ### Segal category
 Definition: A Segal category is a simplicial space satisfying the Segal condition with discrete space of objects $X_0$.
 Correct.
 ### Homotopy hypothesis
 Definition: The homotopy hypothesis asserts that $n$-groupoids model homotopy $n$-types, with $\infty$-groupoids modeling all homotopy types.
 Correct.

 Correct.
 ### Monoidal category

 ### Icon
 Definition: A 2-morphism in a double category filling a square of 1-morphisms.
 Actually, an "icon" (Identity Component Oplax Natural transformation) is a concept for bicategories. 
 It is a lax natural transformation whose 1-cell components are identities. 
 But in the context of double categories, it might be used for a 2-cell that is "in the identity direction". 
 However, the given definition is vague. 
 I think the intended meaning is a 2-cell in a double category that is a square. But that is just a general 2-cell. 
 The term "icon" is specific to a particular type of transformation. 
 This might be inaccurate.

 ### Serre duality
 Definition: In a triangulated category, a contravariant equivalence $D: \mathcal{C}^{op} \to \mathcal{C}$ with natural isomorphisms $\text{Hom}(X,Y) \cong \text{Hom}(Y,DX)^*$.
 This is for a Serre functor in a $k$-linear category. But note: the star might denote dual, so it's often written as:
   $\text{Hom}(X,Y) \cong \text{Hom}(Y, DX)^*$ 
   which is not exactly Serre duality in algebraic geometry. 
 In the context of coherent duality, Serre duality is an isomorphism in cohomology. This definition seems to be for a Serre functor in a triangulated category.
 However, the definition given is standard for a Serre functor.

   $Rf_* R\mathcal{H}om_X(F, f^! G) \cong R\mathcal{H}om_Y(Rf_* F, G)$
   for $G$ in $D(Y)$.
 The given definition sets $G = \mathcal{O}_Y$, but it's a special case. The general form is more common.
