## ✅ **Classical Category Theory**

### 1. **Abelian category**
- **Definition**: Correct.
- **Comments**: The definition aligns with the standard one: additive category with kernels/cokernels, monos = kernels of cokernels, epis = cokernels of kernels. The prototypical example (category of abelian groups) is accurate.

---

### 2. **Additive category**
- **Definition**: Correct.
- **Comments**: The key points are present: preadditive, zero object, finite biproducts. This is a standard definition.

---

### 3. **Adjoint Functor Theorem**
- **Definition**: Mostly correct, but could be clarified slightly.
- **Suggested revision**:
  - Emphasize that the solution set condition must hold *for each* object `c` in `C`.
  - Clarify that the domain category `D` must be **locally small** and **complete** (has all small limits).
  - Also note that this applies to the **General Adjoint Functor Theorem**; mention the **Special AFT** as well if desired.

---

### 4. **Adjunction**
- **Definition**: Correct and comprehensive.
- **Comments**: Covers both hom-set isomorphism and unit-counit formulation, including triangle identities. Very solid.

---

- **Definition**: Correct.
- **Comments**: Standard. The automorphism group notation `Aut(X)` is common and clear.

---

### 6. **Balanced category**
- **Definition**: Correct.
- **Comments**: Accurate. Some categories like **HausTop** are balanced; others like **Ring** are not.

### 13. **Copower / Tensoring**
- **Definition**: Mostly correct.
- **Clarification needed**: The general case (enriched over `V`) should specify that `v ⊗ X` is an object in `C`, not in `V`. Also, clarify that `Hom_C(v ⊗ X, -) ≅ Hom_V(v, Hom_C(X, -))` is a natural isomorphism in `v ∈ V`.

---

### 14. **Copresheaf**
- **Definition**: Correct.

### Minor Suggestions:
- Clarify some edge cases (e.g., coends, coefficient, cosegment).
- Ensure consistency in use of terms like “universal” and “initial/terminal.”
- Add brief notes on which definitions are less commonly used or more specialized (e.g., cosegment, coefficient).

Overall, this document is an excellent resource and reference. Let me know if you'd like help turning it into a formatted PDF or LaTeX version!
