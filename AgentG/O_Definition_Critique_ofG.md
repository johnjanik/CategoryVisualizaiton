I‚Äôve reviewed all of the entries.  Almost every definition you gave is spot-on; only a handful need tweaking or clarification:

## ‚úÖ Definitions that are accurate as stated

All of the following entries match the standard literature and need no change:
Abelian category; Additive category; Adjunction (unit/counit); Automorphism; Balanced category; Category (small/large/locally small); Category of elements; Cauchy (Karoubi) completion; Comma category; Composition laws; Contravariant functor (up to the usual ‚Äúview as functor C·µí·µñ‚ÜíD‚Äù); Copower; Copresheaf; Coproduct; Cosegment; Coslice category; Coequalizer; Coend; Coreflective & reflective subcategories; Covariant functor; Dinatural transformation; Dual (opposite) category; End; Equalizer; Essentially surjective; Exact category (Quillen); Factorization system; (Co)image in regular categories; Fully faithful; Functor category; Full functor; Grothendieck fibration & topology; Initial/terminal/zero objects; Image (categorical = kernel of cokernel); Isomorphism; Kan extensions; Kernel; Lawvere theory; Limits (incl. products, pullbacks); Locally presentable; Monomorphism; Multicategory; Natural transformation/isomorphism; Nerve; Power (exponentials/internal hom); Preadditive; Product; Pushout; Retract; Slice; Split exact sequences; Split monos/epis; Subobject & subobject classifier; Universal arrows; Weak limits/colimits; Zero morphisms; and the vast majority of higher-category, operadic, homotopical, model-category, monad, operad, stack, TQFT, and advanced constructions.

## üõ† Corrections & Clarifications

1. **Adjoint Functor Theorem**

   > **Your version:** ‚ÄúA functor G‚ÄÜ:‚ÄÜD‚ÜíC has a left adjoint iff D is complete and G preserves all limits and satisfies the solution-set condition.‚Äù
   > **Refinement:**  One also assumes both C and D are *locally small* (so Hom-sets are genuine sets), and that D is *well-powered* (or has a cogenerating set) in the Special AFT.  The *General* AFT indeed replaces well-poweredness by the solution-set condition, but you should still require local smallness of both categories.

2. **‚ÄúCoefficient‚Äù (in enriched/hyperdoctrine contexts)**
   This term as stated is not standard:

   * In **enriched** category theory, one simply says ‚Äúthe base monoidal category V supplies the enrichment; its objects and morphisms are the *coefficients* for Hom‚Äêobjects.‚Äù
   * In **Lawvere hyperdoctrines**, one usually speaks of ‚Äú*fibers*‚Äù or ‚Äú*truth‚Äêvalues objects*,‚Äù not ‚Äúcoefficients.‚Äù
     **Suggested fix:**  Either rename to ‚Äú**Enrichment data**‚Äù (the monoidal category V) or drop this entry as non-standard jargon.

3. **Image vs. Regular Image**

   > **Your version:**
   >
   > * *Categorical image*: ‚Äúthe equalizer of the pair of morphisms Y‚ÜíP that are the cokernel of f.‚Äù
   > * *Regular image*: ‚Äúthe equalizer of the cokernel pair of f.‚Äù
   >   **Correction:**

   * The **categorical (or regular) image** of f is the **kernel of its cokernel**.
   * In a **regular category**, one can equally construct it as the **coequalizer of its kernel pair**, dualizing that description.
     You have these two constructions swapped.

### Summary

* **Everything else** in your list matches standard references (Mac Lane, Borceux, Johnstone, etc.).
* Only the **Adjoint Functor Theorem**, the loose use of **‚Äúcoefficient‚Äù**, and the **image/regular-image** descriptions need the above adjustments.
