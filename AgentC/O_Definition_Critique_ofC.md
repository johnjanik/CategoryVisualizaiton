Here’s a high‐level pass over your list up through the entry **Topos** — almost every entry is essentially spot‐on; I’ve flagged only those places where the usual definition is slightly more nuanced or where some standard hypothesis was omitted.  Everything else you can treat as correct.

## Classical Category Theory

* **Abelian category**

  * *Minor note:* “pre-abelian” means “additive + all kernels and cokernels exist.”  Your two “mono is a kernel” / “epi is a cokernel” axioms then *do* force every morphism to factor (as you list).  So you might simply remark that “an abelian category is an additive category with all kernels and cokernels in which every mono and epi is normal (i.e.\ mono = kernel, epi = cokernel).”

* **Additive category**

  * ✔️  Accurate.

* **Freyd’s General Adjoint Functor Theorem**

  * *Missing hypotheses:*  One also assumes that

    1. the target category \$\mathcal{D}\$ is complete, and
    2. the source category \$\mathcal{C}\$ is locally small (so comma‐categories are essentially small).

* **Adjunction**

  * ✔️  Complete and correct.

* **Automorphism**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Balanced category**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Category, Composition, Monomorphism, Epimorphism, Isomorphism, Initial/Terminal/Zero object, Zero morphism**

  * ✔️  All of these are exactly right.

* **Category of elements**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Cauchy (Karoubi) completion**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Comma category**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Contravariant / Covariant functor**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Copower**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Copresheaf**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Coproduct / Product**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Cosegment**

  * ✔️  An uncommon term, but your description “two maps from the terminal object” is exactly the dual of a segment.

* **Coslice / Slice category**

  * ✔️  Your notation \$c!/\mathcal C\$ for the *coslice* (objects \$c\to d\$) and \$\mathcal C/d\$ for the *slice* (objects \$d\to c\$) is standard.

* **Coequalizer / Equalizer**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Coefficient**

  * ⚠️  Not standard terminology in enriched category theory.  Usually one speaks of the *base* or *enriching* category \$\mathcal V\$ rather than “coefficients.”

* **Coend / End**

  * ✔️  Perfect.

* **Coreflective / Reflective subcategory**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Dinatural transformation**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Dual (Opposite) category**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Essentially surjective / Fully faithful / Full functor / Fully faithful functor**

  * ✔️  All three are correctly stated.

* **Exact category**

  * ✔️  You have the right idea: an additive category plus a Quillen‐style class of “short exact sequences.”

* **Factorization system**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Functor / Functor category**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Grothendieck fibration**

  * ✔️  Correct (one usually unpacks “cartesian lifting” further, but you’ve given the heart of it).

* **Grothendieck topology**

  * ✔️  Correct (the “identity” axiom is the requirement that the maximal sieve covers every object).

* **Image**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Kan extension**

  * ✔️  Correct as stated; one often unpacks “left Kan extension” as the universal arrow into the precomposition functor, but you have the adjoint‐functor version.

* **Kernel**

  * ✔️  Correct in an abelian setting; one usually adds “equalizer of \$f\$ and \$0\$.”

* **Lawvere theory**

  * *Minor tweak:*  One usually starts with a *skeleton* of finite sets (denote it \$\mathsf{Fin}\$) and a strict, *identity‐on‐objects* finite‐product‐preserving functor \$\mathsf{Fin}^{op}\to\mathcal T\$ whose image generates \$\mathcal T\$.  Your description is essentially that, but replace “\$\mathcal F\$” by “the skeleton \$\mathsf{Fin}\$ of finite sets.”

* **Limit / Colimit**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Locally presentable category**

  * ✔️  You need “cocomplete + accessible (i.e.\ generated under filtered colimits by a set of \$\kappa\$-compact objects for some regular \$\kappa\$).”  That’s exactly what you said.

* **Monomorphism / Epimorphism**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Multicategory**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Natural transformation / Natural isomorphism**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Nerve of a category**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Opposite category**

  * ✔️  (Duplicate of “Dual category.”)

* **Power**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Preadditive category**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Pullback / Pushout**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Retract**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Split mono / split epi / Split exact sequence**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Subobject**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Universal arrow / universal property**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Weak limit / weak colimit**

  * ✔️  Correct.

* **Zero object / Zero morphism**

  * ✔️  Correct.

## Basic Higher Category Concepts

All ten entries—from **Complicial set** through **Homotopy hypothesis**—are stated correctly at just the level of detail you’d expect in a glossary.

---

## Types of Higher Categories through Adjunctions & Duality

Entries under **Cartesian closed**, **Closed**, **Compact closed** categories; **Double**, **Enriched**, **Internal**, **Monoidal**, **Braided**, **Symmetric** monoidal categories; up through **∞-adjunction** are all correctly stated.  (You’ve covered duality, biadjunction, lax/pseudo notions, etc., in full.)

---

## Monads & Algebras; Operads & Algebraic Structures

* **Monad / Comonad / Eilenberg–Moore / Kleisli / Barr–Beck**
  ✔️  All classic and accurate.

* **Operad / PROP / Lawvere theory (again) / Topological, symmetric, cyclic, modular operads**
  ✔️  Correct.

* **Dendroidal / Colored operads; Properads; ∞-operads; ∞-properads**
  ✔️  All fine.

---

## Topology & Homotopy Theory; Model Structures

Your entries for **Classifying space**, **Loop space**, **Fundamental ∞-groupoid**, **Homotopy fiber**, **Suspension**, etc., as well as **Model category**, **Quillen adjunction/equivalence**, **(Enriched/Simplicial/Monoidal) model categories**, **Bousfield localizations**, etc., are all exactly as one finds in standard references.

---

## Advanced Constructions up through **Topos**

* **Yoneda embedding for ∞-categories**

* **Grothendieck construction**

* **Straightening/unstraightening**

* **Orthogonal factorization system**

* **Exact ∞-category / Stable ∞-category / Presentable / Accessible ∞-category**

  ✔️  All correct.

* **Topos**
  ✔️  Spot-on: a category of sheaves on a site, equivalently a finitely complete cartesian closed category with a subobject classifier.

* **Higher topos / (∞,1)-topos**
  ✔️  Correctly stated as the ∞-categorical analogues satisfying Giraud‐style axioms with all higher morphisms invertible beyond level 1.

### Summary

* **Everything** except the few points noted (Freyd’s theorem hypotheses; the typical source for Lawvere theories; the nonstandard term “coefficient”) is *accurate* as written.
* No substantive errors were found—the corrections above simply fill in a couple of standard extra hypotheses or clarify terminology.

Feel free to let me know if you’d like any of these entries expanded or if you want deeper references for any of the more advanced constructions!
